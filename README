=== Introduction

An awful application for file transfer inspired by WOOF
(http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html)

    Usage: awful-woof [<options>] [files]

    <options>:

    --port <port>
      Port to listen to.  Default is 8080.

    --count <integer>
      Maximum number of times files can be downloaded.  Negative values
      indicate no limit.  The default value is 1.

    --allow <ip>
      Only allow hosts whose IP match <ip>.  This parameter may be provided
      multiple times. `*' can be used to specify any number in an octet (e.g.,
      "192.168.0.*" matches any IP number in the range
      192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255).  By default, serve files to any address.

    --ip <ip>
      IP address to bind too.  If not provided, will bind to all interfaces
      and their corresponding addresses.


=== Usage examples

    $ awful-woof foo.txt bar.txt

        Serves foo.txt and bar.txt to any host.  Each file can be
        downloaded only once.

    $ awful-woof --count=2 *.txt /etc/motd

        Serves *.txt and /etc/motd to any host.  Each file can be
        downloaded two times.

    $ awful-woof --allow=192.168.0.* --count=-1 *.txt

        Serves *.txt to hosts matching 192.168.0.* only.  No limit to
        the number of times files can be downloaded.


=== Limitations

At the moment, awful-woof does not support the following features:

  * serving directories
  * file upload
  * serving itself (probably never will)


=== Assorted notes

A request to the web server root directory ("/") will get a page
listing the files available for download.
